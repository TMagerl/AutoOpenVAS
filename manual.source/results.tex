\breakpoint\section{Results}

\breakpoint\subsection{JSON file}

\hint If you do not use any monitoring solution or scripts you can skip this part. Simply visit the OpenVAS web interface to get results (see\toimg{integration_active}) or use console output\tosec{print_console}.

All gathered values are stored to the configured \emph{export path} using JSON format. The file name corresponds to the MAC address.

\codein{output.json}{json}{sample - output.json}

\breakpoint\subsubsection*{MAC and IP}
Initially defined (passive mode) or found (active mode) IP and MAC address.
Please see the verify MAC option on \tosec{verifymac}.

\breakpoint\subsubsection*{severity}
OpenVAS displays the max severity value (0-10) for each machine. \sw returns the sum of every severity of the machine for a more meaningful value.
If the machine was not available during the last test, the severity of the last successful test is returned.

\breakpoint\subsubsection*{stamp}
This is the timestamp of the last successful test.

\breakpoint\subsubsection*{link}\label{sec:link}
This is a direct link to the latest report of the machine. If there is no report (yet) it points to the task or target if available.

\breakpoint\subsection{Console}\label{sec:print_console}
You can print the results to console by using the \emph{-print} switch.

\codein{print_console.txt}{json}{print console output}
